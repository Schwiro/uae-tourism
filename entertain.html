<h2>ENTERTAINMENT</h2>


<center style="margin-top:7%;margin-right:50px;margin-left:50px">
	<h3>What is Entertainment?</h3>	
	<p>Entertainment is a form of activity that holds the attention and interest of an audience, or gives pleasure and delight. It can be an idea or a task, but is more likely to be one of the activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience's attention. Although people's attention is held by different things, because individuals have different preferences in entertainment, most forms are recognisable and familiar. Storytelling, music, drama, dance, and different kinds of performance exist in all cultures, were supported in royal courts, developed into sophisticated forms and over time became available to all citizens. The process has been accelerated in modern times by an entertainment industry which records and sells entertainment products. Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale, ranging from an individual who chooses a private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products; to a banquet adapted for two; to any size or type of party, with appropriate music and dance; to performances intended for thousands; and even for a global audience. The experience of being entertained has come to be strongly associated with amusement, so that one common understanding of the idea is fun and laughter, although many entertainments have a serious purpose. This may be the case in the various forms of ceremony, celebration, religious festival, or satire for example.</p>

  	<p>The UAE is home to a wide variety of entertainment, with examples including: sports, cinema, games, theatre, social dance, comedy shows, and many more. Due to the modern era, several sports were introduced to the UAE such as football, golf, polo, tennis, rugby, sailing, yacht and motor racing with Emiratis being especially zealous fans of football. Although there are many different cinemas spread throughout the country, the most popular cinema by far is Vox Cinemas. Owned and operated by Majid Al Futtaim Cinemas, VOX Cinemas is the cinema arm of Majid Al Futtaim, the leading shopping mall, retail and leisure pioneer across the Middle East and North Africa. With 50 locations totalling 514 screens across the region, VOX Cinemas is the Middle East’s largest and most rapidly growing exhibitor. However, theatre is also a widely popular choice among people. Theatrical life in UAE is actually rich with stories, anecdotes and situations of humanitarian and intimacy. Many have missed from this life, many stuck to, many retreated from the theatre, many rushed to it. In all this process from its inception till this day, the theatre remains as an art of live, beauty, and great human purity.</p>
