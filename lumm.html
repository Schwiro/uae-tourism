        <h2 style="padding-top:5%;padding-bottom:2%">Al Ali Fort</h2>
        <p>Upon entering through Bab Al Sabah gate, time pulls you back in the deep history. It is exactly Al Ali fort which represents the most ancient historical building in Umm Al Quwain, it was firstly established by H.H.Sheikh Rashid Bin Majid Al Mualla,the foundator of Al Mualla Royal Family, in 1768 as a residence and  venue for his Government. </p>

        <ul>Facts
            <li>Having a significant effect on the memory of Umm Al Quwain citizens, this fort represents the image of the royal family's power and dignity.</li>
            <li>Two golden swords, one matchlock, some  memorial coins and others are available in the Ruler's Properties Room. In addition to that, a collection of old golden jewelries which reflect the traditional gold manufacturing in Arab Gulf area which was given to the museum by Her Highness, Sheikhah Shamsah Al Majid , wife of His Highness Sheikh / Rashid Bin Ahmed Al Mualla.</li>
            <li> Sheikh Hamad Bin Ibrahim Al Mualla was murdered in the fort in 1929 - shot and killed on 9 February 1929, by a slave called Saeed from the household of Hamad's blind uncle, Abdelrahman bin Ahmed Al Mualla.</li>
            <li>Hamad was succeeded by Ahmad bin Rashid Al Mualla following a colourful incident whereby the population of the town rose up against Abdelrahman and Saeed, who had barricaded themselves in the fort. </li>
            <li>The people of the town elected to set a fire around the walls of the fort and in this conflagration both Abrelrahman and Saeed were killed.</li>

        <h2 style="padding-top:5%;padding-bottom:2%">Abandoned IL-76</h2>
        <p>The plane is a Soviet Ilyushin Il-76 cargo plane. Currently it has an advert on the side for the Palma Beach Hotel, but its past is far more interesting.</p>

        <ul>Facts
            <li>The aircraft was built in 1975 in part of the Soviet Union that is now Uzbekistan. </li>
            <li>In the early Eighties it flew as a Soviet military transport plane (under the registration CCCP-86715).</li>
            <li>After the collapse of the Soviet Union it flew for the Russian air force (with registration RA-86715) and then in the early Nineties it was sold to the Sharjah-based airline Air Cess.</li>
            <li>Air Cess was a company formed by Sergei Bout, the brother of notorious arms dealer Viktor Bout, who was the inspiration for an arms dealer character played by Nicolas Cage in the 2005 film Lord of War.</li>
            <li>Originally set up in Belgium, Air Cess moved to Sharjah in 1997. The cargo plane was then transferred to a company called Air Pass. </li>
            <li>This company was disbanded when South Africa’s Civil Aviation Authority charged Air Cess with 146 breaches of civil aviation law.</li>
            <li>The airline, just as Bout himself was apt to do, simply reorganised and changed name once again. This time, in 1998, to Centrafrican Airlines. At present, the plane is listed as “derelict” but Centrafrican Airlines is its last registered owner. The company finally ended operations in 2001 while the UAE laudably banned Bout from entering the country in the early 2000s.</li>
