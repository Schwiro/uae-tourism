        <p>The Corniche is 8 km long, and includes children's play areas, separate cycle and pedestrian pathways, restaurants, caf√©s and the Corniche Beach. It forms a sweeping curve on the western side of the main Abu Dhabi island and is replete with cycle paths, fountains and park areas. Between 2002 and 2003, land was reclaimed from the sea and the Corniche was extended. Some of the earlier landmarks were demolished in the process. Certain parts of the Corniche have significant deposition of sand, with people using the area as a public beach. </p>

        <ul>Facts
            <li>Marina Mall is located across from the Corniche and can be accessed using a narrow breakwater road</li>
            <li>At Marina Mall, the UAE flag is hoisted and holds the record for being one of the tallest flagpoles in the world.</li>
            <li>Lulu Island is a tiny reclaimed island located about a kilometer from the corniche and the Emirates Palace Hotel is at the southern end.</li>
            <li>Prior to the 1970s, the current area occupied by the Corniche was a beach, where dhows and ships used to anchor and transfer cargo or people</li>
