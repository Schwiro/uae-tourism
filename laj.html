        <h2 style="padding-top:5%;padding-bottom:2%">Ajman Museum</h2>
        <p>With a fascinating collection of artefacts housed in a beautifully restored fort, Ajman Museum is one of the most visited historical attractions in the emirate.You’ll find the museum on the east side of the central square in the Al Bustan area. The museum opens from Saturday - Thursday (8:00am - 8:00pm), and on Friday (2:30 pm - 8:00 pm) and displays are annotated in both Arabic and English.</p>

        <ul>Facts
            <li>Ajman Museum is the emirate’s foremost museum illustrating life as it once was.</li>
            <li>The 18th-century fort served as the ruler’s residence until 1970, before it was converted into a museum a decade later.</li>
            <li>The exhibits offer a compelling glimpse of Ajman’s past, from centuries-old manuscripts and weaponry to models of wooden dhows and ingenious irrigation systems.</li>
            <li>One of the most notable displays is an excavated cemetery discovered in the Al Muwaihat area, which features pottery and funeral jewellery dating back as far as 3000 BC.</li>
            <li>A section is devoted to the pearl trade that once dominated the region, while the fort itself is a perfect example of traditional Emirati architecture.</li>

        <h2 style="padding-top:5%;padding-bottom:2%">Wasit Wasteland Centre (Ajman Border)</h2>
        <p>Part of a much larger initiative by Sharjah’s Environment and Protected Areas Agency to clean up and rehabilitate this ancient chain of wetlands along the Persian Gulf coast, the Wasit Wetland Centre aims to supply information and education about this unique environment and to encourage its preservation.</p>

        <ul>Facts
            <li>The architects took advantage of the site’s natural topography to minimise its visual impact by making it appear submerged into the ground.</li>
            <li>A cantilevered steel truss roof over the viewing gallery avoids the need for peripheral columns, allowing seamless glazed façades.</li>
            <li>The interior is deliberately minimalistic throughout, placing the full focus on the surrounding nature: informative displays are the only adornment on the supporting central wall.</li>
            <li>What had become a waste dumping ground has had its indigenous ecosystem restored, and is proving a popular place for visitors to appreciate and learn about their natural environment.</li>

        <p>With one million square metres of natural mangrove forest, Al Zorah Nature Reserve is a haven for bird and marine life.</p>

        <ul>Facts
            <li>Al Zorah Nature Reserve is a vibrant ecosystem made up of mangroves, turquoise lagoons and sandy beaches, which is home to nearly 60 species of bird including pink flamingo, egret and heron.</li>
            <li>It is part of the Al Zorah community, a new development set along 12 kilometres of waterfront and 1.6 kilometres of sandy beaches that boasts an 18-hole Championship golf course.</li>
            <li>With seven kilometres of waterfront, two kilometres of beach and a tidal creek, the nature reserve is made for waterborne activities.</li>
            <li>The best way to explore the mangroves is by kayak, and the calm waters and network of channels make it suitable even for novice paddlers.</li>
            <li>Golfers, meanwhile, can tee off at the 18-hole Championship golf course at the nearby Al Zorah Golf Club.</li>
