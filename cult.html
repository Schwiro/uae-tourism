	<h3>What is Culture?</h3>	
	<p>Culture is the characteristics and knowledge of a particular group of people, encompassing language, religion, cuisine, social habits, music and arts.The position that the ideas, meanings, beliefs and values people learn as members of society determines human nature. People are what they learn. Optimistic version of cultural determinism place no limits on the abilities of human beings to do or to be whatever they want. Some anthropologists suggest that there is no universal "right way" of being human. "Right way" is almost always "our way"; that "our way" in one society almost never corresponds to "our way" in any other society. Proper attitude of an informed human being could only be that of tolerance.</p>

<h3 id="h31">What is the Culture of the UAE?</h3>
<div class="container">
  	<p>The UAE has a rich culture and heritage that reflects traditional Arab and Islamic values. Environment and terrain also influenced the lifestyle. Read to know about the different aspects of the Emirati culture and their inspirations then and now.The UAE is blessed with a rich heritage that encompasses architecture, sports, occupations, traditions, arts, crafts, food, places of historical and archaeological importance, lifestyle and values imbibed in Islam. This page attempts to give you a peek into the UAE's glorious heritage and the UAE's efforts to preserve it amidst the modern changes.Music, dance, poetry, pottery, weaving and embroidery were popular forms of art in the olden days. Today, paintings and literature have joined the art forms thriving in the UAE.Owing to the harsh climatic conditions, agricultural produce was limited in the olden days. Hence, the Emiratis relied on animal products. Some Emirati dishes have a hint of Arabian, Indian, Iranian, Mediterranean and Turkish influences.To promote tolerance, the UAE appointed a Minister of State for Tolerance, launched the National Tolerance Programme, passed the Anti-discrimination/Anti-hatred law and set up centres to counter extremism.</p>

<h3>Why should you know the culture of the UAE?</h3>
<p>It does not matter whether you are a tourist or resident, it is imperative to understand the culture of a country as lots of problems can arise from misunderstandings, especially because we live in a multicultural world. By learning and understanding different cultures you understand why people do things the way they do. When you identify with other people, you sympathize with their situation</p>

<h3>Religion and Beliefs</h3>
<p>The UAE Emiratis are mainly Sunni Muslims and Sharia (Islamic) law regulates all social and political matters. The UAE is tolerant of other faiths, however and grants the expatriate population religious freedom. Hinduism, Christianity, Sikhism and Buddhism are mainly among these religions. While Muslims can proselytize with those of other religions, it is forbidden for Muslims to proselytize with those of other religions. Muslims are not permitted to convert from Islam, and those who deliberately attempt to persuade Muslims to convert to a new religion have consequences. As an example, there have been instances of people being held and then deported from the UAE for the distribution of bibles. Though bibles are not illegal in themselves, it is illegal to give them out to Muslims.</p>

<h3>Arts, Humanities and Popular Culture</h3>
<p>The UAE has a long cultural history which dates back to ancient times, derived from many evolving cultures. From the Bedouin tribes migrating across the deserts to the centuries of pearl harvesting along the Arabian Gulf. Today, the UAE is proud of its cultural past while welcoming and encouraging contemporary arts, literature and theatre. There are art galleries, museums and theatres in Dubai, offering an insight into the past and the future of the arts. In 1998, the City of Sharjah was voted the Cultural Capital of the Arab World and houses a local history museum, once the residence of the Ruling Dynasty, at the Fort of Sharjah. Known as the 'Garden City,' the oasis town of Al Ain is a UNESCO World Heritage Site with its natural springs and palm groves. The Al Ain National Museum shows archaeological discoveries from around the area, including stone age and bronze age remnants. Contemporary literature, poetry and performing arts are taking their place in popularity, particularly that of spoken poetry that has its roots in historical tradition. Long regarded as the 'poetry of the people,' Nabati poetry is still very much a part of contemporary literature and has for centuries captured the lives and behaviors of changing cultures.</p>

<h3>Giving Gifts</h3>
<p>All gifts should be of a high quality. Good perfume is acceptable even for men who take a pride in the appearance and status but such a gift for a woman should only be given by another woman. Gifts with a personal touch that show thoughtfulness are very acceptable. Never give alcohol, pork products, knives or dog related items.</p>
