	<h3>What is Tourism?</h3>	
	<p>It is the act and method of spending time away from home in search of leisure, relaxation, and enjoyment, by utilizing the commercial provision of facilities. As such, tourism, while it has antecedents in Classical antiquity, is a result of modern social arrangements, starting in western Europe in the 17th century.Tourism is distinct from exploration in that tourists follow a "beaten path," benefit from proven supply chains, and are usually isolated from challenge, risk, and embarrassment, as is fitting for pleasure seekers. However, tourism overlaps with other events, desires, and procedures, including pilgrimage, for instance.This gives rise to categories that are shared, such as "business tourism," "sports tourism," and "medical tourism" (international travel to obtain medical care).</p>

<h3 id="h31">What is the UAE?</h3>
<div class="container">
  	<p>The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is a federation of seven states that has grown from a quiet backwater to one of the Middle East's most important economic centres. Although traditionally conservative and authoritarian in government, the UAE is one of the most liberal countries in the Gulf, with other cultures and beliefs generally tolerated. In 2020 it became the first Gulf state to establish diplomatic relations with Israel. Relations with neighbouring Iran have been tense because of an ongoing territorial dispute over Gulf islands. The UAE was one of only three countries to recognise Taliban rule in Afghanistan. Before oil was discovered in the 1950s the UAE's economy was dependent on fishing and a declining pearl industry. But since oil exports began in 1962, the country's society and economy have been transformed. The UAE has diversified and has become a regional trading and tourism hub. UAE firms have invested heavily abroad.</p>

<h3>Why should you visit the UAE?</h3>
<p>There’s no shortage of reasons why you should visit the United Arab Emirates. This small country located in the Persian Gulf is home to the tallest building in the world, some of the most luxurious hotels ever seen and a mixture of tradition and novelty that can rarely be found in other countries. The best reasons to visit the UAE can be found in each of its Emirates, all of which offer their own unique experiences. These will be further talked upon in each Emirate's section.</p>
